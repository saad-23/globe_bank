** Some Important concepts in php and also in this current project **

1. set/define constants for file or target_file path (e.g,, stylesheet,images,assets etc).
2. we can send values from one page to other via URL parameters also called as query parameters
3. PHP store those URL_para_values in an associative array
3. URL_para_values can be accessed through super_global variable $_GET[key_name].
4. URL_para_values are always string although we send an integer value.
5. Whenever use dynamic value, then always use any html-encoded method for output that value e.g,, htmlspecialchars().

5. three methods for detect form submission
		1-> check submit key value through isset($_POST['submit'])
		2-> check every field key value through isset($_POST['name']),,etc
		3-> checking the request method is post or get e.g.. 		$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']=='POST' // and this is most usefull method
6. if we define variable globally outside any function scope, then we have to use global keyword with that variable when using in function scope.
7. MYSQL commands:
		using cli in windows for mysql practice, we have to go to the "c:\xampp\mysql\bin" this directory or path then enter "mysql -u saad -p" this command.
		Below are important SQL commands:
			SHOW DATABASES;
			USE db_name;
			SHOW TABLES;
			SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;

// ************* Command For creating table*******
			create table subjects(id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	    menu_name VARCHAR(255),
	    position INT(3),
	    visible TINYINT(1),
	    PRIMARY KEY(id));

	    create table pages(id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	    menu_name VARCHAR(255),
	    position INT(3),
	    visible TINYINT(1),
	    subject_id INT,
	    content TEXT,
	    PRIMARY KEY(id),
	    FOREIGN KEY(subject_id) REFERENCES subjects(id)

	    );

// Alter command for adding index for foreign key constraint

	    Alter table pages add index fk_subject_id (subject_id);

// Insert Commands

	    insert into pages(menu_name,position,visible,subject_id,content) values('Banking',3,1,1,'some content for Banking');

// Alternate way to insert data in database
	    insert into subjects set menu_name='local',position=3,visible=1;

Database APIs in PHP:


For PHP Database interaction, there are 5 steps to follow:
	1. Create a database connection
	2. Perform a database query.
	3. Use the returned data.
	4. Release the returned data.
	5. Close the database connection
1st and last(5th) steps will only perform once in php script but other 3 steps will perform more than once in a script.
	For database connection:
		mysqli_connect($host,$user,$password,$dn_name);
		$host is a location of a server to which we want to connect

Important points about mysql:
	1. select query returns the result set
	2. Update, delete and create/insert queries returns the True or False

------------------------------------------------------------
Work with Retrieved data from database:
	-> 3 methods for retrieving data from mysql database by using procedural mysqli database API
			1. mysqli_fetch_row()
				-> results are in standard array(index-array)
				-> keys are integers
			2. mysqli_fetch_assoc() Most preferable
				-> results are in associative array.
				-> keys are column names
				-> this is more better method than the 1st one
			3. mysqli_fetch_array()
				-> Results are in either or both types of array
				-> we use constants such as MYSQL_NUM,MYSQL_ASSOC,MYSQL_BOTH
